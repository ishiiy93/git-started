        <p>Yoda is one of the most powerful Jedi Masters and probably the oldest too. He only stands 66cm, or 2 feet 2 inches tall, but "<i>Size matters not.</i>" He may have messed up a bit when he wasn't able to recognize that Chancellor Palpatine was a bad guy, but we all forgive him because he's so nice to the baby Jedis and teach them all that he knows.. Most notably Luke Skywalker!</p>
